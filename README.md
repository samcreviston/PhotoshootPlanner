# PhotoshootPlanner

# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm working to expand my skills in web development by practicing with various useful API integrations, such as the Google Maps API in this project.

This is a web-based photoshoot location planner that displays an interactive Google Maps interface showing various photography locations throughout North Georgia. Users can browse through a scrollable list of locations, view color-coded markers on the map (green for parks & nature areas, yellow for trails, blue for other locations), and click on locations or markers to get detailed information about each spot's photographic potential. The data includes 23+ carefully curated locations ranging from urban centers to nature preserves, trails, and scenic areas.

The purpose of this software is to help photographers quickly identify and explore potential photoshoot locations in the North Georgia area, providing detailed descriptions of what makes each location unique for photography and allowing easy visual exploration through the interactive map interface.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension for testing and development. The project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build tools or frameworks to keep it lightweight and simple, focused on the goal of utilizing the Google Maps API.

The project integrates with the Google Maps JavaScript API to provide the mapping functionality and marker management.
